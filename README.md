    Previously, I sometimes met the expression "open source in a repository on GitHub" on the net, 
    but I did not understand what it meant and how to use it. 
    
    Thanks to "Introduction to Git and GitHub" course, I gained an understanding of the technology 
    and its importance in the modern world of software development.
